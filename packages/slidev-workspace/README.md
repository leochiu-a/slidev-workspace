Slidev Workspace is a specialized command-line tool designed to manage and showcase multiple [Slidev](https://sli.dev) presentations. It provides a unified web interface to browse, search, and access Slidev presentations distributed across different directories.

## Features

âœ¨ **Multi-presentation management** - Organize multiple Slidev presentations in one workspace  
ðŸ“± **Responsive interface** - Clean, modern UI for presentation management  
ðŸ”§ **Easy configuration** - Simple YAML-based configuration  
ðŸ“¦ **Build & Deploy** - Built-in commands for production builds  
ðŸŽ¨ **Thumbnail previews** - Visual presentation previews in the workspace

## Usage

Slidev Workspace provides two flexible ways to work with your presentations:

### Built-in Preview Interface

Use the command-line tool for an out-of-the-box solution:

```bash
slidev-workspace preview
```

This launches a responsive web interface with presentation management, search functionality, and thumbnail previews - perfect for users who want to get started quickly without building custom UI.

### Content API

For developers who need custom UI integration, access slide data programmatically:

```typescript
import { useSlides } from "slidev-workspace";

const { slides } = useSlides();
```

The `useSlides` composable returns frontmatter data from all discovered presentations, enabling you to build entirely custom interfaces while leveraging Slidev Workspace's presentation discovery and parsing capabilities.
